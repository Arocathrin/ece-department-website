  <h2>Academic Programs</h2>
    <p>The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at Karunya University offers a comprehensive range of academic programs designed to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge in the field of electronics and communication. The programs include:</p>
       <ul class="pdf-links">
      <h3>B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)</h3>
      <p>At the undergraduate level, students are familiarized with various operational principles of electronic devices and circuits using the latest technology. They are also trained to work with software such as MATLAB, FEKO and XILINX.</p>
      <p>Special efforts have been made to enable the students to translate the theoretical knowledge into practical scenarios through laboratory and field level experiences. Students are motivated to undergo in-plant trainings and mini projects which provides necessary industrial exposure. They are also encouraged to take up their final semester project in industries so that they are well exposed to industrial practice.</p>
      <a class="pdf-btn" href="ECE.pdf" target="_blank">B.Tech ECE</a>
      <h3>B.Tech. in Electronics and Computer Engineering (ECM)</h3>
      <p>B.Tech in Electronics and Computer Engineering (B. Tech ECM) is designed in such a way that students will be exposed to the design of electronics in the entire computer systems and developments. Through the basics of electronic concepts, the students will be trained to design new hardware and software for AI, IoT, Cyber physical systems, cloud and cognitive computing applications.</p>
      <p>In the future, graduates having these skill sets will be grabbed by industries working for military and defense applications, IoT industries, software enabled services, automobile, healthcare, agriculture applications, Embedded solutions, etc.,
To achieve this, the curriculum has been formulated in consultation with experts from various industries and technologists around the globe.</p>
       <a class="pdf-btn" href="ECM.pdf" target="_blank">B.Tech ECM</a>
      <h3>M.Tech. in VLSI Design</h3>
      <p>The main objective of this course to produce world class professionals with wide knowledge in VLSI latest technologies and to enhance their skills in designing VLSI Chips for industrial requirements. The programme curriculum is aimed at VLSI system design, Hardware description Languages, System Architectures, Physical designs, Verification techniques, Low power design techniques, Mixed mode design methodologies, VLSI signal processing, Analog VLSI design, device modeling and fabrication, and MEMS.</p>
      <p>It also focuses to achieve excellence in research using the latest technologies. VLSI students are in great demand in various core companies like Intel, IBM, Texas Instruments, Cadence, Synopsis, Mentor Graphics, T & Vs etc. and also in major IT companies such as TCS, Wipro, Infosys, CTS and Accenture.</p>
      <p>Research opportunities in premier Institutes such as IITs, NITs, and Foreign Universities in the latest areas of the programme. VLSI students have wider opportunity to take up projects under “Make in India” and “Digital India” schemes by Government of India.</p>
      <h3>Ph.D. in Electronics and Communication Engineering(Full-time and Part-time)</h3>
      <p>The Department of Electronics and Communication offers both full time and part time Ph.D. programmes in all major areas of Electronics and Communication engineering. Ph.D. Research activities are carried out in the thrust areas of Nano Devices, Image Processing, Medical Image Analysis, Signal Processing and Communication Networks.</p>
      <p>The department has the eminent faculty to guide the research scholars and has excellent research facilities for conducting research.</p>
      <p>The faculty regularly publishes their research work in peer-reviewed international journal and conferences. The school frequently conducts national level and international level conferences/seminars to enhance academic and research interaction among researchers.</p>
